# Mining Resources

Resources are a central part of the microservice dungeon. It brings economical value into the gameplay.
Each resource can be mined by robots and later [sold for moneten ðŸ’¸](/rules/trading)

**There are five different kinds of mineable resources**

| Resource | Cost | Rarity |
| -------- | ---- | ------ |
| Coal     | 1,5  | 16     |
| Iron     | 3    | 7      |
| Gem      | 6    | 3      |
| Gold     | 12   | 2      |
| Platin   | 24   | 1      |

After every mining or scanning of a resource field the player which has mined or scanned said room gets notified of the remaining amount of resources.

Resources can be depleted.

Upon depletion a new resource spawns at a random location on the map.

If a Robot mines with a full Inventory all mined resources are lost to space.

Multiple robots can mine at the same room, with no Upper limit.
