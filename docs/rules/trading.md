# Trading

Spacestations are the points of trading. You can sell resources for moneten and buy several upgrades.

**You can buy:**

- New Robots (you don't have to be on a spacestation to buy a new robot)
- Robot Upgrades
- Special Items
- Energy Restoration
- HP Restoration

The costs for HP Restoration depends on the Level of that Robots Max HP independent of how much HP you are acctually repairing. Same goes for Energy Restoration and Max Engery Level.

You can only repair a robot to max HP.

When buying a new Robot it will spawn on a random spacestation.

Each Robot can hold an unlimited amount of Special Items.
