# Architecture Overview

The-Microservice-Dungeon is a microservice architecture project.

We have build several microservices, which are communicating with each other.

![Overview](/img/gameflow.png)

This picture is a great starting point to understand how The-Microservice-Dungeon is working.

## Game

This service is the orchestrater of the project.

* `Players` can join the `Game`.

* When a `Game` is started, it orchastrates the timing on the base of which the other services are communicating.

* `Players` are sending Commands to the `Game`. These Commands are collected for the specific round and forewarded to the recivieng microsercie. E.g. ich a `player` wants a `Robot` to move, the `Robot` recevies the command

## Player

The `Players` join the `Game` and issue commands to interact with The-Microservice-Dungeon.

## Robot

The `Robots` are like the extendet arm of the `Player`.

* The `Player` issues a command to a `Robot` which then can interact with the `Map` or with other `Robots`. E.g. move to another Planet on the `Map`.

## Trading

`Trading` is used in three different ways

* First it acts as a bank depot for the `Players`, and controlls if the `Players` has enough [moneten ðŸ’¸](/rules/trading) for a purchase.

* Second it can generate Robots after an Issues "buy robot" command of the `Player`.

* Third `Trading` is controling the economy, by adjusting prices, in relation to the `Game`-situation on the battlefied.

* Forth `Players` upgrade their `Robots` by buing upgrades or single use Items with the "buy" command

## Map

Map manages the gameworld and is responsible for generating and linking planets and their resources.

## GameLog

This service tracks the progress of the `Players` and the `Game`.

* On one hand it works as a log service for the `Game` and protocols the commands.

* On the other hand it serves as a leaderboard, which displays the `Players` progress throug points and achivements
